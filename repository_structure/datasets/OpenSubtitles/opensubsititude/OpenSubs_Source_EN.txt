Come on!
Get up, bastard!
The boss, teacher... and father are one.

Dusabu- ilche My Boss My Hero
Myeogdong is the bridgehead to Gangnam!
Though Du- shik has taken over Myeogdong.
The area is too important for him
- to be in charge!
- I agree, boss!
These days, younger brothers have all graduated from high school and a lot of them went to college.
Du- shik didn' t even finish high school!
Please reconsider, boss!
- Good work in Myeongdong yesterday.
- I owe everything to you, Big brother.
You know how to be modest.
You' ve matured.
Byeong- hun, that son of a bitch.
What a fool.
A mere subordinate and he dares to betray the family?
Hopeless bastard...
- Have another drink.
- Thank you, Big brother.
Hey, Du- shik!
Do you have e- mail?
Shit... you take me for a fool?
What' s your e- mail address?
Apt.
303.
What are you doing?
I' m setting up a cafe on the net.
Cafe?
A fucking cafe?
You can' t make money off that shit!
Big brother told us... not to do anything that makes no money, dumbass!
- Hey, Head!
- What?
I' m only telling the truth!
Do you know what the Internet is?
- You think I' m stupid?
- Do you e- mail?
I fucking mail this shit everyday!
I can mail this shit 12 times a day!
12 times, moron!
Whatever.
That' s what happened?
Didn' t the boss of the Jongro family go to college?
It seems people who went to college always think that they' re better!
- I' ve never said that.
- Bull shit!
You were saying internet this, e- mail that, cafe this and that, you liar!
Big brother, do you know what a net cafe is?
Is it in our district?
You' re really ignorant, Big brother!
He said, "Is it in our district?"
Why is Head always like that?
That sort of thing is unimaginable in Las Vegas.
- You' ve been to Las Vegas?
You have no common sense, moron!
You have to have common sense, punk!
Write your name.
Seriously, Big brother.
In Chinese characters.
I' il leave Myeondong open till the end of the year, just get your high school diploma.
Then, if anyone has any problems with that, I' il take care of it.
Do you understand?
Yeah...
Big brother.
The cops are all over the Myeongdong incident.
Head, you must run the business and take care of our family in the boss' s absence.
Where are you going, Big brother?
Big brother will be gone for a while
Big brother!
You can' t go to prison!
I' il go in your place!
- We should be going.
- I' il go instead.
Really, Big brother.
Thanks.
- Big brother...
- Instead of school, how about a private learning institute?
- Private institute?
- My cousin goes to one... in Noryangjin.
That' s where the best institutes are.
They have great teachers and high college acceptance rates!
Really?
But...
Do Institutes give out diplomas?
- If you give them money.
- Oh!
The world has become a better place to live!
Let' s have a round of applause for our improved educational system!
Come on, come on, come on!
So, the first half should be focused on Korean, Math and English, and the second half on the overall general curriculum for the final spurt!
That' s it!
Spurt!
Spurt is important!
But... what' s a general curriculum?
I lowered your age.
Born in 1981, 20 years old.
20 years old?
People often say that you look like you' re in your early twenties.
I do look young for my age.
It would be difficult to enter public schools, so I looked into private ones.
I found a private school with a good reputation and competent teachers.
- Really?
- Sangchun High School in Gangnam.
Sangchun?
You' ve been admitted by way of contribution.
Contribution?
What' s that?
You give, and you take.
Also, the important thing is... it' s co- ed.
Big brother!
I' ve looked into a great place, institutes with high rates in...
- Noryangjin!
- It' s the best, Big brother!
High rates and good teachers, and...
- General curriculum!
- They give out diplomas!
And...
How do I look?
Something wrong?
Nobody slicks their hair back in high school these days.
Gye Du- shik Enters High school
Congratulations, Big brother!
What the fuck is this?
Big brother!
I' m so proud of you.
Ask if you don' t know, moron.
You have no common sense.
- Repeat after me, common sense.
- Common sense!
Fuck, you have no common sense!
Who bought this bag?
What?
I did, Big brother!
I had to get you something with you going back to school and all.
Big brother, that bag... is made in USA.
And these pants?
How many times do I have to tell you, moron?
Lips!
I told you to ask me many times if you don' t know!
Just ask!
Big brother, I' il get you a backpack by tomorrow.
How can I trust him to run things?
Stop the car over here.
It' s too far from school...
Just pull over!
If I say pull over, just pull over!
It' s stuck.
It smeared, darn...
Hey, you!
Hold the gate!
- What?
I' m only telling the truth!
Do you know what the Internet is?
Fooling around with the students.
- Hello.
- Good morning, students!
Let' s go.
We' ve got a lot of collecting to do today.
Isn' t that right, Dong- pal?
Right, Gyeong- sil?
Right?
Answer me!
Who are you?
I just transferred today.
You should have told me!
It' s okay.
Get up.
Stand up, it' s alright.
I said get up, you punk!
Have you lost your mind?
Have you no manners?
Being late on your first day!
You have no head?
- That motherfucker!
Come here!
- Be quiet.
I' il take responsibility!
Call the whole family!
You scared me, bitch!
How can a girl have so much leg hair...
Why do you keep coming to the women' s restroom?
Go to the boy' s room, sissy!
Are you crazy?
If I were doing this in there, they' d beat the shit out of me!
Freak... you think that' il straighten out your frizzled hair?
- You' re insane...
- You talk way too much, sister.
Don' t worry about my hair.
Just worry about your own tight hairstyle.
- Kyeong- sil.
Do you have any pads?
- Hey, Yun- ju.
Anyhow, you girls are way too sloppy.
- Thanks.
I' il get you back.
- Only the 'White' brand!
What?
Don' t be looking at me like that, sister.
Freaks and geeks.
Chain smoking bitches.
Hope you all get lung cancer and rot.
So annoying...
- What did you just say?
- What did I do?
You wanna die?
Wanna die, punk?
What?
- Retard!
- Why' d you hit him?
I pity your parents who I' m sure were happy when they had you.
Hey, Ji- hye.
That' s a bit harsh!
Don' t be upset.
Hey, seeing you up close, you look really poor.
What' s going on!
You girls can go.
Why are you picking on those girls?
Are you hoodlums?
Are you gangsters?
You don' t study and you' re picking fights.
You little brats!
Are you out of your minds?
- Mr. Jo!
- Yes.
- Please come here.
Sure.
Have they been causing trouble?
- What have you kids done?
- Don' t worry, they were fighting among themselves.
I' m just giving them a notice.
Mr. Jo, this is the new student.
He' il be placed in your class.
- This is your homeroom teacher.
- What' s this?
'White'?!
What ya looking at, punk?
Have you all eaten?
My name is Gye Du- shik.
Pleased to meet you, everyone.
Settle down.
Is there an empty seat?
Over here, Mr. Jo.
This one' s empty!
Du- shik, go sit over there.
- Who had clean- up duty yesterday?
- The third row.
I' m surprised that the classroom is so clean.
Now, we' il begin where we left off yesterday.
Fighting!
Sang- du!
To me?
That' s right!
What the hell...
Solve the problem!
Social Tatoo- ism?
You think you' re a gangster?
Huh?
You brat!
Hey, Du- shik!
Come here.
You have a rat in there or something?
- What' s this?
A rat tail?
- Stop!
Fuck you!
I' il rip your damn pupils out!
Nobody slicks their hair back these days.
True!
You' re better off slicking it back.
Heard you were set back 2 years.
Yeah...
I was set back a year, which would make you a year older than me.
- Oh, really?
- What?
Call you Big brother?
There' s no need for that...
So what' s your story?
'Yes, M' amm!'
'You should work hard!'
You must' ve been shining shoes or delivering food... am I right?
A gangster.
What?
I was a gangster.
You punk!
If you were a gangster I' m the freaking Godfather!
- You crazy?
- Are you out of your mind?
What an idiot!
- Is this it?
- That' s all that I have.
You disrespect, disregard, disdain, discount and defy me?
You little...
You think I' m a bum?
Huh?
If I find a single coin on you,
- I' m gonna burn your little rat tail!
- Really, this is all I have.
Search him!
Why you gotta make trouble?
And be thorough!
Teachers are coming!
Let' s go!
Come here, moron.
You' re one lucky bastard!
You got something on your shirt.
What' s on your shirt?
Moron!
Hey, bring a carton of cigarettes tomorrow!
- Lights for me!
- Shit.
A gangster?
What a moron...
- Do you work today?
- Pretty much everyday.
Take it easy.
What you gonna do with all that money?
Buy us dinner!
Have you no shame?
Always trying to live off other people' s wealth!
Shut up, you' re so annoying.
No red beans in this.
- Bye.
- See you tomorrow.
Oh... this?
Our eminent chairman' s mother- in- law died.
Lady!
Give me a carton of cigarettes.
What?
Hey!
Give me a carton of cigarettes!
You little brat!
Who the hell you think you are?
- Get out of here!
- Don' t worry, I' m not a student.
Then what are you, a gangster?
Get out!
Get out of here!
You' re gonna disrespect us again?
Hey!
You' re mad, huh?
So what you gonna do?
Take a swing?
Stand up straight!
- Stand straight!
- Friends!
You know what that is?
That' s your mother laughing at you!
Friends?
You think we' re friends?
Well, this is how I treat my friends!
Had enough?
- Here' s more!
- Hey!
Friends!
I really have to graduate this year.
Please.
I know how you feel.
I really do.
I' ve been there.
Really.
Just do me a favor, Just one favor.
Let' s just all get along.
Yeah, yeah...
Okay.
Okay, friends.
Suck this!
I can' t get along with you!
- Moron!
- You crazy?
Get along?
Crazy moron!
Later, moron!
Was that for real?
You tick me off, moron!
Crazy nut!
Jerk!
That bastard' s nothing without a stick.
What a poser.
- Bring it on!
- Yes, Big brother.
Big brother, there' s a phone call.
What the hell...
I' m bleeding.
Hello?
Big brother!
What?
Lunch?
Oh, my god!
May I help you?
Do you know Gye Du- shik?
Yes, he' s the one that came to school late yesterday...
Well, I' m his uncle...
He forgot his lunch today.
He' s so forgetful.
I' il give it to him.
Well...
May I ask a rather forward question?
Excuse me?
Have you had lunch?
Damn!
Check out moron' s lunch!
Shit!
You must be rich, moron!
All my mother ever gives me are rice cakes.
This is good!
Why don' t you eat, moron!
Please try some of this.
No, thank you.
I can' t eat pickles.
Really?
I' m allergic.
- You' re from Algeria?
- No, I have an allergy.
Right, allergy!
Yes.
I know someone famous for elegy.
Who?
Lee Mi- ja!
Don' t you know the singer?
The queen of elegy?
"Lady...
Came... llia... "
I don' t know her.
If you ever have any trouble, call me.
If by chance... someone doesn' t pay you back borrowed money... or you become a victim of credit card fraud, call me right away.
I am a boy.
You are a girl.
You are a girl.
Shit, school' s so hard these days.
They didn' t have this in my days.
Verbs and shit.
- What!
- Why are you being silly?
We learned all this in middle school.
I am a boy!
You are a girl.
You are the student.
- Come here!
- Huh?
Son of a bitch!
They didn' t have this in middle school!
They didn' t have this!
What are you looking at!
You' ve never seen a person buy books before?
I am a boy.
You are a girl.
They didn' t have this in my day!
What the hell am I doing?
Let' s just buy something!
Like you' d know anyway.
The boss ordered us to be thorough.
Thorough?
Like he' s ever gonna look at these books.
They have academic scholarships, so Yun- ju will be able to go to college.
Don' t worry.
I' il make sure she goes to college.
- Please, trust me.
- Thank you, sir.
Get the car ready!
Big brother' s about to leave.
Big brother!
- Could I speak to you for a second?
- What is it?
English has become essential in today' s global society.
That' s correct.
So I' m asking you...
Could you please give this to your English teacher?
- You' re out of your league.
- Big brother!
I went to college.
Damn... motherfucker...
You little retard...
What are you doing?
- Well, this...
- What' s this?
It' s too small...
I' m sure that you are all aware that our Sangchun Foundation also runs a general hospital among other things.
However, the Urology department has been in deficit for some time.
So, we' re going to encourage all students to receive circumcision.
- Is it free?
- How would the Foundation survive if it were free?
Gye Du- shik!
Why did a young kid like you do this to yourself?
It' s completely covered with beads.
- What' s that?
- Sunflower.
- Doctor.
- What?
You forgot the anesthesia.
Let me go!
Let me go!
Help me!
Please excuse me for just a moment, but I' ve got something to say.
I want to tell you about an incident that happened 5 years ago the Seojin Room Salon murders which I' m sure many of you remember.
I...
- Open the door!
- Are you sure?
We' re not sure yet, but we' il need to look into it.
I' m positive!
He was in a school uniform but I' m sure it was Du- shik!
Do your best for your success!
I love Jesus, love Jesus...
Jesus Christ, hallelujah!
Yes, I' m his father.
Where did Sang- du attend college?
College?
What college?
He was expelled from high school!
That fucking liar!
Sang- du!
Why can' t you make the profit from a great location like this?
Tell me, you bastard!
Big brother, it' s all my fault.
I didn' t properly teach my business know- how to Sang- du.
It' s my fault.
That was my biggest mistake.
Hey, hey...
Isn' t that Du- shik?
You morons, I should just...
- Everyone inside!
Hurry up!
- Big brother!
It' s my fault!
- Inside!
Inside!
- It' s really my fault, Big brother!
- Come on!
- Big brother...
It' s all my fault, Big brother!
Moron, what do you think you' re doing?
- I can' t believe this.
- Look at you, all dressed up.
Suit and tie, hair slicked back...
- What are you looking at?
- You work here?
- Shit!
You punk ass moron...
- Who plays here?
Huh Chun- hwa, Ahn Su- ni and Kim Haeng- guk.

Mustache?

Hey!
Sing one of his songs!
Sing, moron!
Come on!
Sing, moron!
Don' t make me hurt you!
Sing!
Be congenial!
Smile and sing, moron!
"A swallowtail butterfly... - in the garden..."
- Dong- pal!
It' s the cops!
I can' t believe you really sang!
Dumbass!
Shit!
Why won' t you follow orders?
When were you told to bring the fee for your graduation album?
And you two... you haven' t paid the supplementary class fees!
How many months?
One, two, three...
Are you two conspiring this?
Are you?
Are you being defiant?
Are you!
- Oh, Mr. Jo!
- What' s going on?
Take your seats.
- Mr. Jo, it isn' t that...
- I said take your seats!
Open your books!
What' s with Ji- hye' s Math grades?
How is she going to get a scholarship with grades like this?
Who' s her Math teacher?
- Mr. Jo...
- Christ...
You know how hot- tempered he can be...
Do you think that I don' t have a temper?
That jerk is good for nothing.
Nothing!
If he can' t collect money, the least he could do is cooperate in these affairs.
- Nothing - Nothing
- Something - Something
Do you understand?
You!
Come here!
